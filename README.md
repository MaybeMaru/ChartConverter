a wrapper for the library moonchart
for easier conversion between charts

based off of https://github.com/nebulazorua/sm-to-fnf
and mainly because i needed to convert vslice charts to stepmania lmfao

in order to compile you need
[mcli](https://lib.haxe.org/p/mcli/)
[moonchart](https://github.com/MaybeMaru/moonchart) (git)
[hxcpp](https://lib.haxe.org/p/hxcpp/)
haxe 4.3 at the least
